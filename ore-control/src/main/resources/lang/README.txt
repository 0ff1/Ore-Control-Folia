The default language files present in this directory should not be modified directly.
They will be overridden on every plugin start. They are only references for adding your own language files.

How to add own language files:

1: Make a copy of one of the existing language directories in this directory.

2: Rename the copied directory to the name of the language you want to add.
Note: To avoid collisions with further added languages it is recommended to prefix your directory. For example: custom_ch.

3: In the directory of your language you find a file called info.yml. This file contains some basic information about the
language, such as the names of the authors and an icon which is shown in the selection gui. Modify those values accordingly.

4: Now you can start translating the files. Once you start the server again the language files will show in the selecting screen.

5: Share your language files!
You can help bringing this plugin to more languages by contributing your custom language files back to the plugin,
they don't need to be completed every bit is helpful.
You can do this by either making a PR (https://github.com/DerFrZocker/Ore-Control) or by sending the language files,
via a discussion post https://github.com/DerFrZocker/Ore-Control/discussions.
